# special-garbanzo
The first half is more or less my learning path in the past two years while the second half is my plan for this year. I tried to make a balance between comprehension and doability. For more extensive lists, you can check Github search or CS video lectures

Hope the list is helpful, especially to whom are not in CS major but interested in data science!

One Month Plan:
You may find the list overwhelming. Here is my suggestion if you want to have some basic understanding in one month:

Learn Python the hard way: Free book
Stanford Statistical Learning (Course page) or Coursera Stanford by Andrew Ng (Coursera, Youtube)
Ng’s deep learning courses: Coursera
Keras in 30 sec: Link
Database by Stanford: Course
Machine Learning:
- Videos:
Stanford Statistical Learning: Course page
Coursera Stanford by Andrew Ng: Coursera, Youtube
Stanford 229: Youtube, Course page
Machine Learning Foundations (機器學習基石): Coursera , Youtube
Machine Learning Techniques (機器學習技法): Youtube
CMU 701 by Tom Mitchell: Course page
- Textbooks:
Introduction to Statistical Learning: pdf
Computer Age Statistical Inference: Algorithms, Evidence, and Data Science: pdf
The Elements of Statistical Learning: pdf
Machine Learning Yearning: Website
- Comments:
Statistical Learning is the introduction course. It is free to earn a certificate. It follows Introduction to Statistical Learning book closely. Coursera Stanford by Andrew Ng is another introduction course course and quite popular. Taking either of them is enough for most of data science positions. People want to go deeper can take 229 or 701 and read ESL book.

Natural Language Processing:
- Videos:
Stanford - Basic NLP course on Coursera: Videos, Slides
Stanford - CS224n Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning: Course web, Videos (2019 winter version: videos)
CMU - Neural Nets for NLP 2017: Course web, Videos
University of Oxford and DeepMind - Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing: 2016-2017: Course web, Videos and slides
Sequence Models by Andrew Ng on Coursera: Coursera
- Books:
Speech and Language Processing (3rd ed. draft): Book
An Introduction to Information Retrieval: pdf
Deep Learning (Some chapters or sections): Book
A Primer on Neural Network Models for Natural Language Processing: Paper. Goldberg also published a new book this year
NLP by Jacob Eisenstein: pdf. Free book draft
Deep Learning in Natural Language Processing by Deng, Li: Amazon
- Packages:
NLTK: http://www.nltk.org/
Standord packages: https://nlp.stanford.edu/software/
- Comments:
The basic NLP course by Stanford is the fundamental one. SLP 3ed follows this course. After this, feel free to take one of the three NLP+DL courses. They basically cover same topics. The Stanford one have HWs available online. CMU one follows Goldberg's book. Deepmind one is much shorter.

Some other people's collections: NLP, DL-NLP, Speech and NLP, Speech, RNN

Deep Learning
- Videos:
Ng’s deep learning courses: Coursera. This specialization is so popular. Prof. Ng covers all a lot of details and he is really a good teacher.
Tensorflow. Stanford CS20SI: Youtube
Stanford 231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition (Spring 2017): Youtube, Couse page
Stanford 224n: Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning (Winter 2017): Youtube, Course page
The self-driving car is a really hot topic recently. Take a look at this short course to see how it works. MIT 6.S094: Deep Learning for Self-Driving Cars: Youtube, Couse page
Neural Networks for Machine Learning by Hinton: Coursera. This course is so hard for me but it covers almost everything about neural networks. Prof. Hinton is the hero.
FAST.ai: Course
- Books:
Deep learning book by Ian Goodfellow: http://www.deeplearningbook.org/. Very detailed reference book.
ArXiv for research updates: https://arxiv.org/. I found it the mobile version of Feedly is useful to follow ArXiv. Also, try https://deeplearn.org/ or http://www.arxiv-sanity.com/top.
- Other:
LSTM: My collection
- Comments:
Ng's courses are already good enough. Reading Part 2 of Goodfellow's book can also be helpful. Learning one kind of DL packages is important, such as Keras, TF or Pytorch. People may choose a focus, either CV or NLP. People want to have deeper understanding of DL can take Hinton's course and read Part 3 of Goodfellow's book. Fast.ai has very practical courses.
